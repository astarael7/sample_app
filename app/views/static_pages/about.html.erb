<p>
  This is a simple blogging app that I am creating to teach myself how to implement user roles
  and host user-sourced content in a Ruby on Rails environment. Significant portions of the architecture are borrowed from the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> tutorial built by Michael Hartl.
